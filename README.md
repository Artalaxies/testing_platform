# Artalaxies: Derivative Token Platform

### Product Direction

Our team decided to focus on Track 3, the DAO toolkit. For our project we specifically explored developing a platform for community management and e-commerce to take place. In addition, we also explored the idea of how to bring NFTs into the physical world.

### Introduction
Artalaxies is a decentralized marketplace that focuses on providing anonomyous art designers a platform to produce and protect their NFT derivatives with the use of web 3.0 tech stack and e-commerce system. The platform allows for buyers to purchase physical products that have the nft content embedded, without the artist loosing ownership of the NFT itself.

Artalaxies is a platform where artists can exhibit their NFT’s and directly communicate with manufactures to sell their products.
The platform has a marketplace where buyers can purchase the designers’ NFT license and then purchase shirts, mugs, sweaters, and other merchandises to sell them in real life.

The benefits of having a e-commerce system backed up by Web3 is that we are able to trace NFTs back to the original owner and that the all transactions are transparent and traceable. For example, if a customer is trying to return a product, the merchant is able to validate if the product came from his shop  to see if it is real or fake. Similarly, the customer can check where the NFT came from to see if it was from his favorite artist or it is coming from a phony.


Our platform tech stack:

-   Developed a bright contract technique for ERC721 tokens to derivative token with ERC1155 interface
-   Upgradeable Solidity Smart Contracts
-   Safe production mechanism
-   Flutter 2.8.1 Framework with Rive, ethers.js and web3.js
-   Cross Platform supported
-   Recent deployment network: Rinkeby Testnet
